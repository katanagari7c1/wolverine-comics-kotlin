# All about Wolverine's comics
Wolverine (aka. James Howlett, Logan, Weapon X...) is an amazing character. And with this Android app you can keep track of all his published comics according to [Marvel's APIs](http://developer.marvel.com/docs).

In addition this was an great opportunity to try some cool things in Android Development, such as:

* Kotlin
* Anko
* Constraint Layouts (only the Detail screen)
* Glide
* JUnit + Mockito in Kotlin
* Clean Architecture
* Dagger 2
* Realm
* ...and more to come
 
To test this app you should get both public and private Marvel API Keys. Once you got them, type them down in a file called `marvelAPI.properties`. There is a template file called `marvelAPI.properties.dist` as a reference.
